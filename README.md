# ExpressReactBase
Express backend with a React front end boilerplate for my projects. Maybe it will be useful to you too :)

This is a project meant to have boilerplate code to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Allow for anyone to pick up a ready to use Express API with React Front End codebase</li>
<li>Have several examples for users new to Express or React to get them quickly going</li>
</ul>

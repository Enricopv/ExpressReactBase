# ExpressReactBase
Express backend with a React front end boilerplate for my projects. Maybe it will be useful to you too :)

This is a project meant to have boilerplate code to:
A.) Allow for anyone to pick up a ready to use Express API with React Front End codebase
B.) Have several examples for users new to Express or React to get them quickly going
